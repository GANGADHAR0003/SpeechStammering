# SpeechStammering
Stammering is a speech disorder characterized by disruptions in the flow of speech, 
including involuntary repetitions (e.g., "My name is J-J-J-J-John"), prolongations 
(e.g., "Can you read me a ssssssstory?"), and silent blocks where speech gets stuck 
(e.g., "---------Can I haveâ€¦"). These challenges can significantly hinder 
communication during emergencies or interactions with voice-enabled devices. To 
address this, we propose a portable device that detects, senses, and resolves 
stammering moments using a standalone voice synthesizer processor for speech 
analysis.
